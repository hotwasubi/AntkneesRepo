    <h1>Student Bio</h1>
      <h2>Anthony Colindres</h2> 
         <p>I am 24 years old, my birthday is January 12th, 1995. 
            I have many interest, my primary ones being outdoors or indoors. I used to live in Colorado where I would spend most of my free time hiking through the mountains with my dogs, Phoebe and Lewis. Since moving to Florida you can find me at the beach or on the river paddle boarding

         </p>
         <p>When I'm not outside, I'm usually playing Xbox or Nintendo. The game genres I play vary from FPS(first person shooter), to RPG(role playing games) and I've recently been getting into fighting games as well.
            If I'm not playing video games or hiking I still try to stay pretty active. In between hiking and video games i enjoy playing soccer and training Jiu Jitsu
